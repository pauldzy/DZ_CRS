#DZ_CRS
Utilities for the management and manipulation of Oracle Spatial and Graph transformations and grids.
For the most up-to-date documentation see the auto-build  [dz_crs_deploy.pdf](https://github.com/pauldzy/DZ_CRS/blob/master/dz_crs_deploy.pdf).

##Installation
Simply execute the deployment script into the schema of your choice.  Then execute the code using either the same or a different schema.  All procedures and functions are publically executable and utilize AUTHID CURRENT_USER for permissions handling.

##Collaboration
Forks and pulls are **most** welcome.  The deployment script and deployment documentation files in the repository root are generated by my [build system](https://github.com/pauldzy/Speculative_PLSQL_CI) which obviously you do not have.  You can just ignore those files and when I merge your pull my system will autogenerate updated files for GitHub.
